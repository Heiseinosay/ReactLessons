What is React?
    - open source library for building user Interfaces
    - not a framework
    - Focus on UI
    - rich ecosystem
React is declarative
    - Tell react what toy want and react will build the actual UI
    - React will handle efficiently updating and rendering of the components
    - DOM updates are handle gracefully in react
Why React
    - Seamlessly integrate react into any of your application 
    - Portion of you page or complete page ir even entire application itself
    - React native for mobile application
Component
    - Represents a part of a user interface
    - They are re-usable and can be nested inside other components  
Component types
    - Stateless Functional Component
    - Sateful Class Component

Functional Component
    - Simple functions
    - Use func components as much as possible 
    - Absence of this Keyword 
    - Solution without using state 
    - Mainly responsible for the UI
    - Dumb/Presentaional
Class Component
    - More feature rich
    - Mainteain their own private Data - state 
    - Complex UI logic
    - Provide lifecycle hooks
    - Stateful/ Smart/ Container

Hooks
    - no breaking changes.
    - Completely opt-in & 100% Backward Compatible.
    - What ever we learned so far in this series still holds good.
    - Using state, lifecycle methods and 'this' binding.

JSX 
    - JavaScript XML (JSX) - Extension to the JavaScript language Syntax.
    - Write XML-like code for elements and components.
    - JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children.
    - JSX is not a neccessity to write react applications.
    - JSX makes your react code simpler and elegant.
    - JSX ultimately transpiles to pure javascript which is understood  by the browser.

JSX Differences
    - class => className
    - for => htmlFor
    - camelCase property naming convention 
        onclick => onClick
        tabindex => tabIndex

Props                       &                       State
Props get passed to the Component                   State is manage within the component
function parameters                                 Variables declared in the function body
props are immutable                                 State can be changed
Accessible:
props - functional components                       useState Hook - Functional Components
this.props - class components                       this.state - class Components

Conditional Rendering -- part 10
1. if/else
2. Elements Variables
3. Ternary conditional operator
4. Short Circuit Operator

List and Keys 
    A "Key" is a special string attribute you need to include when creating list of elements.
    Keys give the element a stable identity 
    Keys help react identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
    Help in efficient update of the user interface.
